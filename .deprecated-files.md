This file tracks deprecated code that should NOT be used or restored.

## Territory Management - OLD POLYGON SYSTEM (DEPRECATED)

**Replaced by**: Postcode-based territory system (November 2024)

**Deprecated files** (DELETED):
- `apps/dashboard/components/admin/territory-page-client.tsx` - OLD polygon drawing UI
- `apps/dashboard/components/admin/territory-form.tsx` - OLD polygon form
- `apps/dashboard/components/admin/territory-map.tsx` - OLD Mapbox Draw polygon tool

**Current system** (USE THESE):
- `apps/dashboard/components/admin/postcode-page-client.tsx` ✅
- `apps/dashboard/components/admin/postcode-map.tsx` ✅
- `apps/dashboard/app/(admin)/territories/page.tsx` → Uses `PostcodePageClient`

**Why deprecated**:
- Manual polygon drawing was replaced with official UK postcode districts
- Postcode system uses 2,727 pre-loaded UK postcodes with boundaries
- More accurate, scalable, and maintainable

**Database tables**:
- `territories` table (old polygon system) - Keep for historical data, DO NOT use in UI
- `postcodes` table (new system) - ACTIVE, use this
- `agent_postcodes` table (new system) - ACTIVE, use this

**Reference commit**: dad5bd3 (Complete postcode-based territory assignment feature)

## Notes for AI Assistants

Before modifying territory-related code:
1. Check this file first
2. Use PostcodePageClient, NOT TerritoryPageClient
3. Never restore territory-page-client.tsx, territory-form.tsx, or territory-map.tsx
4. Check git history with: `git log --oneline --all --grep="postcode"`
5. If unsure, ask the user before making changes
