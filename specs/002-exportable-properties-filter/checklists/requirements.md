- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

✅ **ALL CHECKS PASSED**

The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for planning.

### Key Strengths

1. Clear user value proposition (reduce 10,880 → 200 properties)
2. Well-defined success criteria (98% reduction, 30-second removal time)
3. Comprehensive edge case coverage
4. Technology-agnostic language throughout
5. Testable requirements with specific acceptance scenarios
6. Clear scope boundaries and dependencies

### Notes

- Specification meets all quality standards
- No clarifications needed - requirements are clear and actionable
- Ready for `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation tasks
