# Specification Quality Checklist: Postcode-Based Territory Assignment

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

✅ **ALL CHECKS PASSED**

The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for planning.

### Key Strengths

1. Clear user value (80% faster than polygon drawing)
2. Well-defined user stories with independent test criteria
3. Measurable success criteria (selection time, cache hit rates)
4. Technology-agnostic language throughout
5. Comprehensive edge case coverage
6. Clear dependencies on free OS Open Data

### Notes

- Specification meets all quality standards
- No clarifications needed
- Ready for `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation approach
